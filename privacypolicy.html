    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 10-11-2024 </p>

    <p>Thank you for using LEARNC ("we", "our", or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information or any other data from users of [Your App Name]. Specifically, we do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> No name, email address, phone number, or any other personal data is collected.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not collect or track your location.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not collect any data related to how you use the app, including interactions, preferences, or app activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>Our app may use AI technology (such as Google Gemini) to generate content based on user input. However, no personal information is collected or stored during these interactions. Any data processed by the AI is handled in accordance with the policies of the AI provider, and we do not retain any data provided by users.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not share any personal data with third-party services. However, we may use third-party services such as analytics tools or advertising networks. These third parties may collect information about your device or usage patterns, but we do not have access to that data, and it is governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
    <p>If you have concerns about third-party data collection, we recommend reviewing the privacy policies of those services.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>While we do not collect personal data, we take reasonable steps to ensure that your interactions with our app are secure and that no unauthorized access occurs to any data you may provide within the app.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy, and the "Effective Date" will be updated accordingly.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email:</strong> popberrystudios@gmail.com</li>

    </ul>

    <p><em>Key Notes:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No User Data Collected:</strong> This policy clearly states that your app doesn’t collect any personal information from users.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> Even if the app uses AI to generate content, ensure that you clarify you’re not collecting any personal data through these interactions. You might want to mention that AI responses are generated on the fly and do not involve storing any personal user information.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> If your app uses third-party services (e.g., for analytics or ads), it's important to note that they might collect data, but that collection is outside of your control. In such cases, you should advise users to read the privacy policies of these third parties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Google Play Requirements:</em> Make sure to include this privacy policy link in both the app (typically in the settings or menu) and on your Google Play Store listing, even if no user data is collected. Google Play requires a privacy policy for all apps, regardless of data collection.</p>
